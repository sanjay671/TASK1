//setup(): Runs once when the Arduino is powered on or reset. It configures the LED pin as an output.
//loop(): Repeats indefinitely. It turns the LED on, waits for a specified interval, turns it off, and waits again.
//digitalWrite(pin, state): Controls the state of the LED (HIGH for ON, LOW for OFF).
//delay(ms): Pauses the program for a specified time in milliseconds


// Define the pin number for the LED
const int ledPin = 13;

// Time interval in milliseconds
const int interval = 1000; // 1 second

void setup() {
  // Set the LED pin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(interval); // Wait for the interval

  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(interval); // Wait for the interval
